		<h2 class="headline">❤MUSIC❤</h2>

		<p style="font-size:23px;">
			I am especially interested in music, especially ballads and ancient Chinese songs.I once learned bel canto and demotic singing for some time, and also mastered a variety of musical instruments,including piano, guitar, guzheng and so on. However, I gave up learning all of them except guitar because of the shortage of time. I took part in a number of singing contest, and won the title of 'top 10 singer' at our school. I also participated in the musical 'Carrie' and performed as the leading role.

			Besides, I used to sing in our school choir and served as a DJ for the broadcasting of our school.Moreover, I am always trying to write my own songs. I once composed one and gave it to my best friend as her birthday present. In the future, I hope that I will know more about the arrangement of music.<br><br>

			I love travelling very much. I have been to a lot of countries and cities in China. However, during this summer holiday, there isn’t enough time for me to go abroad. Instead, I took part in the summer course at NYU and other colleges(2019). I hope that through this process, I will have a better knowledge about the campus and make a wise decision about choosing the college.<br><br><br><br>

		<h2 class="headline">❤TEA❤</h2>
		<p style="font-size:23px;">
			Many people may think that only middle-aged people love to drink tea,however,I am quite addicted to drinking all kinds of tea, such as Guanyin tea,Oolong tea, Longjing tea and so on. I recommend drinking tea to all of you! It is much healthier than drinking the milk tea sold in popular stores.<br><br>
